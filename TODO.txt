# create random images appear on the list, that later on we will sort 

#click the image and make it go into a different location

#create an array or list of areas where our bird are going to appear 

# we can only select the bird that is first on the list 

# we can only send it to the new location if the bird in that new location is the same kind of bird as him



# when you have 5 birds of the same kind in and area we make them fly away
